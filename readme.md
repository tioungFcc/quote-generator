This is a freecodecamp project. I used React and scss. The React part was not as challenging as the css to learn and assimilate, especially as concerns inline styling with variables. Also, I believe that when I first started to work on that project, the css transition property did not work on the background property and so I spent a lot of time trying to custom implement that. But it looks like today, this is pretty much supported across all main browsers.
My main weaknesses from this project: css inline styling, animations, etc.
